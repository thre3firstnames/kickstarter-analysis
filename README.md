# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Visualize the outcomes of those Kickstarter campaigns similar to Louise’s.
### Purpose
Examine those campaigns that encompass the initial criteria and compare their success rates based on the originating month and funding goals.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Based on the data, Kickstarter campaigns having to do with theatre that begin in May or June are more likely to succeed.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Campaigns with goals less than $5000 have a far higher chance of success than those projects with higher goals.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
- The dataset available to us for this analysis is outdated. Other factors surrounding live theatre in a COVID world should factor into future analysis, should Louise wish to start another campaign. 
- Dataset encompasses many countries across the globe, and we do not distinguish between any kind of hemispherical differences in seasons. However, since Louise wishes to hold her production in the United States, we should consider narrowing our focus to *only* the United States. 


## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1. Overall, it appears that theatre campaigns are more likely to succeed than fail on Kickstarter
2. It seems that theatre campaigns launched towards the end of the year have about an equal chance to succeed as they do to fail. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
1. If funding goals are greater than $45000, campaigns appear far more likely to fail.
2. Roughly half of the campaigns fell in the $1000 - $4999 range, and the success rate of those campaigns is near the highest for plays. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
1. We’re not given any data on when a campaign becomes fully funded; should this date fall before the given end date
2. Without data on the contributions of each backer, we’re not seeing the full story of how the campaign performed. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
1. Pledges based on launch date would likely give insight into which points in the year backers were more likely to donate money to an artistic pursuit.
2. Success & failure rates based on *Staff Pick* and *Spotlight* might guide how best to promote campaigns to find backers.
